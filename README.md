The input file should be a dictionary of the form:
data = {"qubits":4,"h":[0],"cx":[(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)]}

Question 1:
The final state I found is the GHZ state, it is a maximally entangled state with equal probability to measure |0000> and |1111> .

Question 2:
The general trend is that the fidelity is decreasing due to the increasing noise.

Bonus:
The general trend is that the entropy is increasing, which means the state is more entangled due to the increasing noise.
